    The CardProvider implementation selected here will determine how the HipChat notification cards are being
    constructed. Out of the box two implementation exist: one that creates an activity card with some extra test
    details, and one that disables cards altogether.<br>
    Custom card providers can be implemented using Jenkins's extension system, and will be offered as an option here
    when found by the extension lookup mechanism.
